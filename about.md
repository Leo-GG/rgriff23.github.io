*Status*

I am in my final year of a PhD in <a target="_blank" href="https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/graduate">evolutionary anthropology at Duke</a>, where I research the ecology and evolution of primates (and sometimes other things). I spend most of my time at an R Console. 

*Side notes*

I play and coach ice hockey- an interest that pops up on my blog from time to time. I currently play for <a target="_blank" href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/interview/2017/04/07/16/0800000000AEN20170407003200315F.html">Team Korea</a>.

These are my pets- Mr. Spock and Mr. Cody:
