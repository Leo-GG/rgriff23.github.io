<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

I am a recent PhD graduate with 9 years of experience analyzing data with R. I have a strong foundation in statistics and research methods in the social and biological sciences. In addition to my R expertise, I have familiarity with Python, MySQL, Matlab, and HTML/CSS. 

For examples of my work, check out my [blog](https://rgriff23.github.io/blog.html) or download my [data science resume](https://rgriff23.github.io/assets/pdfs/Randi_Griffin_resume.pdf). You can also [fork me](https://github.com/rgriff23) on GitHub, [follow me](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37) on Kaggle, or [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randigriffin) on LinkedIn.

*Presently*

I will be participating in the [Insight Data Science Fellowship](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in Boston starting on September 10, 2018. I'm super excited for this opportunity to expand my data science skills and professional network! Until then, I'm spending my summer cramming in as much Python and machine learning as possible.

*Past Work*

My academic research focused on the evolution and ecology of primates (everything from [morphology](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/09/reflect-3d-points-across-plane.html) to [social networks](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/04/26/primate-social-networks-in-igraph.html)) and parasites (everything from [mosquitoes](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/05/23/mosquito-community-ecology-in-vegan.html) to [tapeworms](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/gelada)). I've done some computer simulation-based [statistical methods research](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/pcm) and authored an [R package](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/btw) that at least a few people use. 

I do a lot of random side projects, such as my web scraping and analysis of [120 years of historical data on Olympic athletes and results](https://rgriff23.github.io/2018/05/27/olympic-history-1-web-scraping.html) (this became a very popular dataset after I shared it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)), or my breakdown of this [Twitterstorm](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/29/Katie-Hinde-Twitterstorm.html) (this was the project I presented in my interview for Insight). 

*Personal*

I live in CT with my girlfriend, dog, and cat. We adopted them from a shelter for animals with laser beams shooting out of their eyes. I was a bit skeptical at first, but it turns out they are great pets and not much more work than normal-eyed pets.

*Ice Hockey*

I am also an ice hockey player. I play professional women's ice hockey for the [Connecticut Whale](https://www.theicegarden.com/2018/7/10/17553146/connecticut-whale-sign-randi-griffin-sarah-hughson-re-sign-hanna-beattie-team-korea-free-agency) and internationally for [Team Korea](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/14/koreas-historic-goal-american-randi-griffin-has-roots-usas-first-gold-1998/336270002/). Previously, I played varsity women's ice hockey at [Harvard University](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/2/1/randi-griffin-15q/). When I'm not playing, I like to coach kiddos!
