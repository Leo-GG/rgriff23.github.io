<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I recently joined [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) as a data scientist on the performance marketing team. Before that, I was a Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/), a 7-week program designed to help recent PhDs land industry data science jobs (it worked!). I got my PhD in [Evolutionary Anthropology](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/) from Duke University, where my research focused on the ecology and evolution of primate morphology, behavior, and infectious disease. 

I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to apply and expand my data science skills. In addition, I'm passionate about paying it forward through outreach, mentorship, and pro bono work. Interested in talking or collaborating? Feel free to [fork me](https://github.com/rgriff23) on GitHub, [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randigriffin) on LinkedIn, or shoot me an e-mail!
