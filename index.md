*Research*

I am finishing a PhD in <a target="_blank" href="https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/graduate">evolutionary anthropology at Duke</a>, where my predilection for R and data analysis have landed me roles in a wide array of research projects. My work includes a lot of GLMMs, social network analysis, survival analysis, simulation studies, multivariate ordination, and other stuff. 

*Teaching* 

I have served as a TA for three undergraduate courses, twice served as an instructor at an annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anthrotree.info/wiki/projects/anthrotree2014/AnthroTree_2014.html">statistical methods workshop</a> for biological anthropologists, and mentored an undergraduate honors thesis student.

*Outreach*

Every year I participate in several events aimed at getting K-12 students excited about science. In addition, from 2015-2016, I served as a "science coach" for 6-8th graders through the Duke <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.duke.edu/boost/">BOOST</a> science mentorship program. 

*Ice hockey*

I grew up playing in NC, then <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/wice/2009-10/bios/griffin_randi?view=bio">played at Harvard</a> from 2006-10. After graduating, I hung up my player skates and got into coaching youth hockey. That is until 2015, when I made a surprise comeback to <a target="_blank" href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/interview/2017/04/07/16/0800000000AEN20170407003200315F.html">play for Team Korea</a>!
