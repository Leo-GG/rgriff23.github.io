<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

I'm a recent PhD graduate with 9 years of experience analyzing data with R. I have a strong foundation in statistics, research methods in the social and biological sciences, and programming.

*Current status*

I will be participating in the [Insight Data Science Fellowship](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) in Boston starting on September 10, 2018. I'm super excited for this opportunity to expand my data science skills and professional network! Until then, I'm spending my summer cramming in as much Python and machine learning as possible.

*Past work*

My academic research focused on the evolution and ecology of primates (from [morphology](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/09/reflect-3d-points-across-plane.html) to [social networks](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/04/26/primate-social-networks-in-igraph.html)) and parasites (from [mosquitoes](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/05/23/mosquito-community-ecology-in-vegan.html) to [tapeworms](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/gelada)). I've done some computer simulation-based [statistical methods research](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/pcm) and authored an [R package](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/btw). 

I do lots of random side projects, such as web scraping and analyzing [historical data on Olympic athletes and results](https://rgriff23.github.io/2018/05/27/olympic-history-1-web-scraping.html) (this dataset became a very popular after I shared it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)), or breaking down this [Twitterstorm](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/29/Katie-Hinde-Twitterstorm.html).

*Personal*

I live in CT with my girlfriend, dog, and cat. We adopted them from a shelter for animals with laser beams shooting out of their eyes. I was a bit skeptical at first, but it turns out they are great pets and not much more work than normal-eyed pets.

*Ice hockey*

I play professional women's ice hockey for the [Connecticut Whale](https://www.theicegarden.com/2018/7/10/17553146/connecticut-whale-sign-randi-griffin-sarah-hughson-re-sign-hanna-beattie-team-korea-free-agency) and internationally for [Team Korea](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/14/koreas-historic-goal-american-randi-griffin-has-roots-usas-first-gold-1998/336270002/). Previously, I played varsity women's ice hockey at [Harvard University](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/2/1/randi-griffin-15q/). When I'm not playing, I like to coach!
