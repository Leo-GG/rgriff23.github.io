___

I'm currently a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science. I have a background in the social and biological sciences, as well as statistics and programming in R and Python. For examples of my work, check out my [blog](https://rgriff23.github.io/blog.html) or [publications](https://rgriff23.github.io/blog.html). [Fork me](https://github.com/rgriff23) on GitHub or [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randigriffin) on LinkedIn!

*Past work*

My academic research focused on the evolution and ecology of primates and parasites. Specific research topics included modeling the [evolution of complex 3D shapes](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/11/10/plotting-shape-changes-geomorph.html), quantifying the structure of [primate social networks](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/04/26/primate-social-networks-in-igraph.html), characterizing the spatial scale of [mosquito habitat preferences](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/05/23/mosquito-community-ecology-in-vegan.html), and proving that [tapeworms can kill monkeys](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/gelada). I've done some computer simulation-based [statistical methods research](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/pcm) and authored an [R package](https://rgriff23.github.io/projects/btw) for fitting Bayesian models of trait evolution.
