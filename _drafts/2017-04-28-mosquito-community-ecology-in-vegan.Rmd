___

In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to use the R package [`vegan`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html) to analyze an original dataset on the abundance of mosquito species in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. I cover the calculation of common diversity indices, comparison of diversity measures across habitat types using linear models, and visualization of patterns in community composition using multivariate ordination methods (both constrained and unconstrained correspondence analysis). 

## Study design

We selected three regions in the Raleigh-Durham area of NC (denoted DU, LW, and PR). Within each region, we identified three 200m transects that spanned a field-forest habitat gradient. We set up 5 traps along each transect, with the field-forest boundary located at the 100m mark. Altogether, this study design resulted in 45 trap locations (3 regions x 3 transects x 5 trap locations). 

Using 6-inch ground resolution imagery from the <a target="_blank" href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">USGS Earth Explorer</a>, we digitally classified the landscape within a 100 meter radius of each trap into 9 categories and computed the proportion of the landscape that fell into each category: grassland, deciduous tree canopy, evergreen tree canopy, mixed tree canopy, shrub, cultivated crops, barren land, pavement, and buildings. 

To collect mosquitoes, <a target="_blank" href="http://johnwhock.com/products/mosquito-sandfly-traps/cdc-miniature-light-trap/">CDC light traps</a> were hung on T-shaped structures built from PVC pipes. Traps were baited with dry ice because host-seeking mosquitoes are drawn to carbon dioxide. Here is a schematic of our study design and a photo of our trap set-up:

Traps were set up at dusk and picked up at dawn. Mosquitoes were taken back to the lab and killed in a freezer before being identified to species level and counted. Collections took place once every 2 weeks over a 5 month period from June 1 to October 15, 2014. 

# The data

Let's open R and load the packages we will need for this analysis, installing them first if you haven't already:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install if needed
install.packages("data.table") # for importing data from GitHub
install.packages("vegan") # community ecology package

# load packages
library("data.table")
library("vegan")
```

Using the `fread` function from the `data.table` package, import the data into R. Let's also specify that `Habitat` is an ordered factor, which will be important for boxplots and linear models. 

```{r}
# read data from GitHub
data <- data.frame(fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgriff23/Mosquito_ecology/master/Analysis/data.csv"), row.names = 1)

# make Habitat an ordered variable
data$Habitat <- ordered(data$Habitat, c("Field", "NearField", "Edge", "NearForest", "Forest"))
```

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the data. There are 45 rows corresponding to 45 traps, with row names indicating the trap ID (DU/PR/LW are the regions, followed by the transect and trap numbers). There are 36 columns, which can be broken down as follows: 

1. columns 1-3: trap characteristics (region, transect, habitat)
2. columns 4-8: landscape variables related to vegetation cover
3. columns 9-12: landscape variables related to man-made structures
4. column 13: number of trap-nights
5. columns 14-36: abundance of mosquito species

I refer to these column numbers when subsetting the data for different analyses. 

## Does species diversity vary across habitats?

This first question requires us to compute mosquito [species diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_diversity) indices for each trap location. We will compute three measures of species diversity:

1. Richness, the total number of unique species found at a site
2. Shannon-Weiner diversity, a common diversity index where species are weighted by abundance
3. Rarefied richness, or species richness estimated with a resampling procedure to control for variation in sample size

Here is code to compute these metrics for each trap site:

```{r}
# mosquito abundance matrix
abundance.matrix <- data[,14:36]

# compute indices and add to new 'indices' data frame
indices <- data[,c("Region","Transect","Habitat")]
indices$Richness <- rowSums(abundance.matrix>0)
indices$Shannon <- diversity(abundance.matrix, index="shannon")
indices$Rarefied <- c(rarefy(abundance.matrix[1:45,], sample=15))
```

Use boxplots to visualize differences in species diversity along our field-forest habitat gradient:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_boxplots, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
par(mar=c(3,4,3,2), mfrow=c(2,2))
colors = terrain.colors(6)[5:1]
boxplot(Richness~Habitat, data=indices, boxwex=0.5, col=colors, 
        cex.axis=0.5, ylab="Richness")
boxplot(Shannon~Habitat, data=indices, boxwex=0.5, col=colors, 
        cex.axis=0.5, ylab="Shannon diversity")
boxplot(Rarefied~Habitat, data=indices, boxwex=0.5, col=colors, 
        cex.axis=0.5, ylab="Rarefied richness")
```

It appears that species diversity increases as we move from the field to the forest. We can test for differences among habitats statistically using a linear model, with `Habitat` as a predictor of species diversity:

```{r ANOVA}
# fit linear models
mod.richness <- lm(Richness~Habitat, data=indices)
mod.shannon <- lm(Shannon~Habitat, data=indices)
mod.rarefied <- lm(Rarefied~Habitat, data=indices)

# ANOVA 
anova(mod.richness)
anova(mod.shannon)
anova(mod.rarefied)
```

The results support the conclusion that diversity is higher in forest habitat than field habitat. Species richness and rarefied richness are both significantly associated with habitat type (*p* < 0.05), while Shannon-Weiner diversity is close (*p* < 0.07).

The estimated coefficients of the linear models tell us something about *how* species diversity is associated with habitat. Since `Habitat` is coded as an ordered variable (Field -> NearField -> Edge -> NearForest -> Forest), the output might look a little different than what you are used to. Look at the estimated coefficients for the richness model:

```{r}
summary(mod.richness)
```
 
There are four estimated coefficients: `Habitat.L`, `Habitat.Q`, `Habitat.C`, and `Habitat^4`. This is because ordered categories are modeled with a polynomial of order *c* - 1, where *c* is the number of levels in the category. In our case, our ordered category `Habitat` has 5 levels, so it will be modeled with a polynomial of order 5 - 1 = 4, e.g., `y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4`. In the model output, `Habitat.L` is the linear coefficient in the polynomial, `b`, `Habitat.Q` is the quadratic coefficient `c`, `Habitat.C` is the cubic coefficient `d`, and `Habitat.^4` is of course `e`. Only the linear coefficient is significant in our models and the coefficient is positive, indicating that our mosquito diversity indices increase linearly as one moves from trap to trap along our field-forest transects.


## Identifying major axes of variation in community composition

In this section we will perform some exploratory [ordination analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics)), which can help us identify 1) which collection sites are most similar in terms of their composition of mosquito species, and 2) which mosquito species are most similar in terms of their distribution across collection sites. Ordination methods are generally more useful for visualization and data exploration than for hypothesis testing, but that is an important role. A community diversity study like this would feel incomplete without some sort of ordination plot.  

Ordination techniques fall into two major categories: *unconstrained* and *constrained*. The most widely used *unconstrained* ordination method is principal components analysis (PCA), which takes a dataset and identifies the axes that optimally account for variation in the data. PCA is agnostic about what factors underly those axes of variation. In contrast, *constrained* ordination is like a mashup of PCA and regression analysis, in which the axes of variation are constrained to be linear combinations of a set of predictor variables. 

The `vegan` package provides functions for performing two popular families of ordination methods: `cca` for 'correspondence analysis', and `rda` for 'redundancy analysis'. Which function you should use depends on your data and what you are interested in. If you want differences in absolute abundance to matter then `rda` is better, but if you want to focus on relative abundances then `cca` is better. For example, if you have the following data:

```{r}
data.frame(Sp.a=c(5,50), Sp.b=c(10,100), row.names=c("Site A", "Site B"))
```

If you want Sites A and B to be considered very similar because the proportions of species are the same, then you want `cca`, but if you want those sites to be considered very different because of the absolute abundances are quite different, then you want `rda`. Generally, if you have raw species abundance data then you will choose `cca`. 

The following table summarizes how you can do both unconstrained and constrained ordination analyses using `cca` and `rda`:

![](http://i.imgur.com/qQrjWBB.jpg?1)

Note that PCA is just an RDA without any explanatory variables, which is why you would run a PCA in `vegan` like this: `rda(abundance.matrix)`.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the three ordination methods on the bottom row of the table, since our species abundance data has not been 'relativized'. First, we will apply correspondence analysis (CA) to the mosquito abundance matrix and visualize the major axes of variation in mosquito community composition. Next, we will perform a constrained CA, also known as canonical CA (CCA), bringing the environmental data into play as predictors of mosquito community composition. Finally, we will perform an extension of CCA called *partial* CCA (pCCA), in which predictor variables are separated into effects you are interested in (i.e., fixed effects) and effects you want to control for (i.e., random effects).  

Before beginning, let's make a couple of small adjustments to our mosquito abundance matrix. First, implement a square root transformation to dampen the influence of large counts on the results. Second, divide counts by the variable `TrapNights` to normalize for the variable number of trap nights due to trap failures. 

```{r}
abundance.matrix2 <- sqrt(abundance.matrix)/data$TrapNights
```

### Correspondence analysis (CA)

For the CA, all we need is the abundance matrix. 

```{r}
# pca
my.ca <- cca(abundance.matrix2)
```

Let's use a barplot to visualize how much of the variance is explained by each CA axes:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_ca_bar, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# barchart for variance of CA explained
barplot(my.ca$CA$eig/my.ca$tot.chi, names.arg = 1:my.ca$CA$rank, cex.names = 0.5, ylab="Proportion of variance explained", xlab="CA axis")
```

We can see that the first CA axis explains a little over 30% of variation in the data. Pull this information directly from the CA object like this:

```{r}
# CA proportions of variance explained
head(my.ca$CA$eig/my.ca$CA$tot.chi)
```

The fact that the first 2 axes only explain a combined ~44% of variation in the data indicates that mosquito community composition is not easily reduced to just one or two axes of variation. Let's look at a scatterplot of our data with respect to the first two CAs:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_ca_biplot, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
# plot
plot(my.ca)
```

It is a bit difficult to see what is going on here. Let's see if we can make a visualization that is a little easier to see. One thing we can do is add colors to represent the different habitats, as we did for the boxplots. Additionally, we can make more space by plotting the sites and species in separate panels. 

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_ca_biplot_pretty, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# 2 panels
layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))

# plot sites
site.cols <- rep(terrain.colors(6)[5:1],9)
plot(my.ca, display=c("sites", "bp"), type="n", xlim=c(-2.5, 2.5), ylim=c(-2, 2.5), main="Sites")
text(my.ca, display="sites", col=site.cols, cex=0.5)

# plot species
plot(my.ca, display=c("species", "bp"), type="n", ylab="", xlim=c(-1.5, 1.5), ylim=c(-1.5, 1.5), main="Species")
text(my.ca, display="species", col="black", cex=0.5)

```

That's better. The color coding helps reveal that the first CA axis appears to reflect a forest-field gradient, which suggests that this habitat gradient is the most important factor structuring mosquito community composition. It also seems like there might be some differentiation among regions, with DU sites clustering near the top of the graph and PR/LW clustering near the bottom. 

With the sites and species separated out, it is now much easier to see the differentiation among species as well. Given that CA1 appears to be a forest-field gradient, we can see that some mosquito species tend to be found in the forest (e.g. *Ae.can*), while others tend to be found in the field (e.g. *Ps.col*). And if we are correct that CA2 corresponds to a regional axis, then *Ae.jap* appears to have an affinity for the DU region (but not much preference for field or forest), while *Ps.cyan* has an affinity for the PR/LW regions (and similarly little preference for field or forest). Species near the center of the graph do not show much differentiation among either regions or habitats. 

### Canonincal correspondence analysis (CCA)

Now we will bring in the landscape variables. Let's make a subset of the data for the landscape variables related to vegetation cover- these will be our predictor variables:

```{r}
# predictor variables
fixed <- data[,4:8]
```

Now we can run the CCA. Let's also compute variance inflation factors (VIF) to check for redundancy in the data. As a rule of thumb, VIF > 10 indicates high levels of redundancy.

```{r}
# cca 
#my.cca <- cca(abundance.matrix2, Y=fixed)

# test for significance of individual variables/axes
my.cca <- cca(abundance.matrix2 ~ ., data=fixed)
#anova(my.cca)
#anova(my.cca,by="terms") # type 1 test (sequential)
#anova(my.cca,by="margin") # type 3 test (marginal effects)
#anova(my.cca,by="axis") # marginal test for axes
mod0 <- cca(abundance.matrix2 ~ 1, fixed)
> mod <- step(mod0, scope = formula(my.cca), test = "perm")

# VIFs
vif.cca(my.cca)
```

Clearly, we have some problematic redundancy in our predictor variables. Let us drop the environmental variable with the largest VIF, Grassland, and see if that fixes the problem:

```{r}
# new fixed effects, without Grassland
fixed <- fixed[,-4]

# cca 
my.cca <- cca(abundance.matrix2, Y=fixed)

# VIFs
vif.cca(my.cca)
```

It seems like that did the trick- all our VIFs are now reasonable. Let's visualize the proportion of variance explained by each CCA axis with a barplot:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_cca_bar, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
barplot(my.cca$CA$eig/my.cca$tot.chi, names.arg = 1:my.cca$CA$rank, cex.names = 0.5, ylab="Proportion of variance explained", xlab="CCA axis")
```

The first axis explains over 10% of the variance. Look at CCA plots:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_cca_biplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# 2 panels
layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))

# plot sites
plot(my.cca, display=c("sites", "bp"), type="n", main="Sites")
text(my.cca, display="sites", col=site.cols, cex=0.5)
text(my.cca, display="bp", col="red", cex=0.5)

# plot species
plot(my.cca, display=c("species", "bp"), type="n", ylab="", main="Species")
text(my.cca, display="species", col="black", cex=0.5)
text(my.cca, display="bp", col="red", cex=0.5)
```

As in the CA, we can see the field-forest gradient reflected along the first axis of variation (note that the direction of the gradient is arbitrary).

Now extract the percent of variance explained by our predictor variables and test for a significant effect of our predictor variables on mosquito community composition:

```{r}
# proportion of variance explained
my.cca$CCA$tot.chi/my.cca$tot.chi

# significance test
anova(my.cca)
```

The vegetation cover variables explain about 39% of variance in mosquito community composition, and this is statistically significant (*p* < 0.001). 

### Partial canonincal correspondence analysis (pCCA)

For our final ordination example, we will build on our CCA by incorporating a matrix of landscape variables related to man-made structures as a  'random effect'. This matrix is called the 'conditioning matrix' in the `vegan` documentation. The effects of these variables will be partialled out of the abundance matrix prior to estimating the effects of the 'fixed effects', which in our case are the landscape variables related to vegetation that we used in the CCA. Let's make a subset of the data for the random effects:

```{r}
# random effects
random <- data[,9:12]
```

Run the pCCA and check the VIFs:

```{r}
# pcca 
my.pcca <- cca(X=abundance.matrix2, Y=fixed, Z=random)

# VIFs
vif.cca(my.pcca)
```

The VIFs look okay, so let's look at our barchart of variance explained:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_pcca_bar, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# barchart for variance of pCCA explained
barplot(my.pcca$CA$eig/my.pcca$tot.chi, names.arg = 1:22, cex.names = 0.5, ylab="Proportion of variance explained", xlab="pCCA axis")
```

The first axis explains just over 9% of the variance. Make the pCCA plots:

```{r post_2017-04_mosquito-ecology_pcca_biplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
# 2 panels
layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))

# plot sites
plot(my.pcca, display=c("sites", "bp"), type="n", main="Sites")
text(my.pcca, display="sites", col=site.cols, cex=0.5)
text(my.pcca, display="bp", col="red", cex=0.5)

# plot species
plot(my.pcca, display=c("species", "bp"), type="n", ylab="", main="Species")
text(my.pcca, display="species", col="black", cex=0.5)
text(my.pcca, display="bp", col="red", cex=0.5)
```

Not a whole lot has changed compared to the CCA. Compute the percent of variation explained by the predictors and test for signficance:

```{r}
# proportion of variance explained
my.pcca$CCA$tot.chi/my.pcca$tot.chi

# significance test
anova(my.pcca)
```

Recall that in our CCA, the predictors explained 39% of variation. Since the pCCA random effects account for some additional variation in the data, the predictor variables explain a slightly smaller overall proportion of the variance in the pCCA, about 32%. 

## Conclusions

Our analyses showed that both mosquito community diversity and mosquito community composition vary along a field-forest gradient, with the forest having greater diversity than the field. Our visualizations allowed us to identify mosquito species that strongly prefer either the forest (e.g., *Ae.can* and *Ae.dup*) or the field (e.g., *Ps.cil* and *Ps.col*).

The three ordination methods produced similar visual results. The fact that the leading axes of the CA and CCA ordinations both represent a field-forest gradient suggests that the predictor variables being included in the CCA represent the dominant axis of variation in the abundance data.
