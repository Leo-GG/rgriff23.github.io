This is the third in a series of posts analyzing data on the modern Olympic Games. Here, I investigate trends in the number of female athletes participating in the Games, where they come from, and which ones find their way to the podium. 

### Conclusion

Up next: Analyzing historical trends in which sports are included in the Olympics.

**Footnotes**

For a comprehensive history of the modern Olympics, I recommend ['Politics, Power, and the Olympic Games'](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Politics-Olympic-Games-Alfred/dp/0880119586/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523105541&sr=8-1&keywords=politics+power+olympic+games) by Alfred Senn. It's a bit dry, but very thorough.
