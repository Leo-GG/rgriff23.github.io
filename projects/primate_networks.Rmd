Years ago, as a baby undergrad, my first ever science project was a comparative study of primate social networks and parasite transmission. It was also my first experience coding: I used Matlab and Mathematica. Since then, I've transitioned to doing virtually all of my stats in R, and I decided it was time to learn how to do network anaysis in R. So I dug up a few primate social networks from my undergraduate thesis, installed `igraph` (Csardi & Nepusz, 2006), and started coding. The result is this tutorial! 

Before beginning, install the `igraph` package and load it into R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

## Importing social network data into R

For this tutorial, we will work with two primate social networks: one for baboons (*Papio papio*) and one for chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*). Both networks come from studies on grooming interactions among troop members (Boese 1975; Arnold & Whiten, unpublished data). The networks are weighted and undirected, and the node labels indicate whether individuals are male or female (the chimpanzee data also indicates whether individuals are adult or juvenile, but we are going to ignore that information). The data are currently in the form of adjacency matrices in *.csv files, so we can read them into R like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Papio.adj <- read.csv("data/Papio_adjacency.csv", row.names=1)
Pan.adj <- read.csv("data/Pan_adjacency.csv", row.names=1)
```

The imported *.csv data is now in a dataframe. We can convert them into `igraph` edgelists like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Papio.edges <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(Papio.adj), mode="undirected", weighted=TRUE)
Pan.edges <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(Pan.adj), mode="undirected", weighted=TRUE)
```

At its simplest, an edgelists is a matrix of two columns: one for "source" nodes and one for "sink" nodes. Each row of the edgelist matrix represents an edge in the network. Edgelists readily scale up to large sparse networks (>1000 nodes), and `igraph` allows you to add attributes to nodes or vertices that can then be harnessed in network visualization and analysis.

## Visualization

Network visualiziation tools in `igraph` are very flexible. Here, I'll demonstrate some basic features and use them to compare sex differences in the social networks of *Pan* and *Papio*. 

We'll begin by focusing on the *Papio* network. Let's look at the most basic plot with all the default settings:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(Papio.edges, main="Papio")
```

We can do a lot better. Let's add colors to represent males and females, and edge weights to represent the strength of interactions among individuals. I'm going to be super gender normative and use blue for males and pink for females. In addition to coloring the vertices, I'll make a number of other aesthetic adjustments to the graph: reduce size of vertices and vertex labels, and color edges black:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define vector of colors based on sex
pap.sexes <- vertex_attr(Papio.edges)$name
pap.sexes <- gsub("M[0-9]*", "skyblue", pap.sexes)
pap.sexes <- gsub("F[0-9]*", "hotpink", pap.sexes)

# Make plot
plot(Papio.edges, main="Papio- pretty version", vertex.color=pap.sexes, vertex.size=10, vertex.label.cex=0.5, edge.width=edge_attr(Papio.edges)$weight*0.25, edge.color="black")
```

There are many algorithms for placing nodes in the plot, some of which force the nodes into particular patterns, and others that try to spread nodes out in a meaningful, visually appealing way. The following 3 X 3 plot shows examples of many layout options available in `igraph`, and also illustrates how to add attributes to the graph object that will lead to automatically generated graphical parameters such as node and edge colors or weights. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Add attributes to new network, Papio.edges2
Papio.edges2 <- set.vertex.attribute(Papio.edges, "color", value=pap.sexes)
Papio.edges2 <- set.vertex.attribute(Papio.edges2, "size", value=10)
Papio.edges2 <- set.edge.attribute(Papio.edges2, "width", value=edge_attr(Papio.edges)$weight*0.1)
Papio.edges2 <- set.edge.attribute(Papio.edges2, "color", value="black")

# Plot window
layout(matrix(1:9, 3, 3, byrow=TRUE))
par(mar=c(1,0,3,0))

# Make plots
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Grid", layout=layout_on_grid, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Circle", layout=layout_in_circle, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Sphere", layout=layout_on_sphere, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Simulated annealing", layout=layout_with_dh, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Force directed", layout=layout_with_fr, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Spring model", layout=layout_with_kk, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Multidimensional scaling", layout=layout_with_mds, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Randomly", layout=layout_randomly, vertex.label=NA)
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Nicely", layout=layout_nicely, vertex.label=NA)
```

![](./primate_networks/Layouts.png)

The default option is "nicely", which will apply a force-directed layout, and usually works pretty well. It attemps to do 5 things (Fruchterman & Reingold 1991):

1. Distribute vertices evenly in the frame
2. Minimize edge crossings
3. Make edge lengths uniform
4. Reflect inherent symmetry
5. Conform to the frame

Since this method generally makes the nodes and edges easy to see, although a potential downside is that the initial configuration of nodes in the force-directed algorithm is random, such that subsequent plots of the same network look different.

Now, let's do a comparison between the *Pan* and *Papio* networks (we'll have to define the color coding for sexes for *Pan*):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define vector of colors based on sex
pan.sexes <- vertex_attr(Pan.edges)$name
pan.sexes <- gsub("[A-D]M[0-9]*", "skyblue", pan.sexes)
pan.sexes <- gsub("[A-D]F[0-9]*", "hotpink", pan.sexes)

# Add attributes to Pan network
Pan.edges2 <- set.vertex.attribute(Pan.edges, "color", value=pan.sexes)
Pan.edges2 <- set.vertex.attribute(Pan.edges2, "size", value=10)
Pan.edges2 <- set.edge.attribute(Pan.edges2, "width", value=edge_attr(Pan.edges)$weight*0.1)
Pan.edges2 <- set.edge.attribute(Pan.edges2, "color", value="black")

# Plot window
layout(matrix(1:2, 1, 2))
par(mar=c(0,0,2,0))

# Make plots
plot(Papio.edges2, main="Papio", vertex.label=NA)
plot(Pan.edges2, main="Pan", vertex.label=NA)
```

![](./primate_networks/PapioPan1.png)

This plot reveals exactly what any primatologist would expect. The matriarchal baboons, *Papio*, have females at the center of the network, and females have numerous interactions with other females. In contrast, the relatively small number of *Papio* males are more peripheral, and there are few relationships between male baboons- rather, male grooming interactions are primarily with females. The patriarchal chimpanzees, *Pan*, have males at the center of the network, and males have many interactions among themselves. In contrast, female chimpanzees are peripheral and appear to interact exclusively with males rather than with each other. 

Based on these networks, it isn't clear who is grooming who. If these networks had directed edges representing the giver and receiver of grooming interactions, we might see even more interesting asymmetries. 

## Analysis

Network metrics fall into two major categories: 1) node or individual-level metrics, and 2) whole network-level metrics. Below, I briefly introduce and demonstrate how to compute some of the most common metrics used in social network analysis, and use them to make quantitative comparisons between the *Pan* and *Papio* social networks.

### Individual level metrics

Individual-level metrics capture the relative "importance" of nodes in a network. There are many different metrics that have different properties, and their appropriateness depends on the research question. The simplest metric is "degree centrality", which is defined as the number of connections for a given node:

```{r eval=FALSE}
```

A slightly more nuanced metric is "strength centrality", which is defined as the sum of the weights of all the connections for a given node:

```{r eval=FALSE}
```
