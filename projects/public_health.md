I have two projects in collaboration with Yale Medical student [Samara Fox](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samara-fox-5483469/):

___

### Project 1: Time to treatment for traumatic brain injury patients in Tanzania

We are analyzing data on the time it took to receive various treatments for patients arriving with traumatic brain injuries at an emergency room in Moshi, Tanzania. We are interested in knowing how patient outcomes can be improved at this hospital.

### Project 2: Mental health in LGBTQ asylum seekers

We are analyzing survey data about mental health and healthcare access among LGBTQ asylum seekers in the U.S. Our goal is to describe the epidemiology of mental health problems in this population and their access to treatment.
