I have two public health projects in collaboration with Yale Medical student [Samara Fox](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samara-fox-5483469/). We are in the data collection/cleaning phases of these projects.

Currently, there are two parts to the project:

___

### Project 1: Time to treatment for traumatic brain injury patients in Tanzania

We are analyzing data on the time it took to receive various treatments for patients arriving with traumatic brain injuries at an emergency room in Moshi, Tanzania. We are interested in knowing how patient outcomes can be improved at this hospital.

### Project 2: Mental health in LGBTQ asylum seekers

This project distributed online surveys about mental health and access to support among LGBTQ asylum seekers in the U.S. We are interested in knowing the epidemiology of mental health problems in this population and their ability to access treatment.
