### Overview

This collaboration with the <a target="_blank" href="https://vectorecology.org/">Vector Ecology Lab</a> at NC State aimed to investigate how mosquito community composition varies across habitats and regions in the Raleigh-Durham area. In addition to collecting and identifying thousands of mosquitoes, I lead statistical analysis for the project. 

### Further reading

Using data and code from this project, I posted a [tutorial (not yet)](/_posts/2017-05-30-mosquito-community-ecology) on my blog that covers the use of `vegan` to compute diversity indices and perform multivariate ordinations. 

The results of this project were published in the *Journal of Medical and Veterinary Entomology*. Download the paper [here](/assets/pdfs/Reiskind_etal_2016.pdf) and view the project on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rgriff23/Mosquito_ecology">GitHub</a>.
