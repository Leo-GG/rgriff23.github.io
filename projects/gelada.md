This multifaceted project centers on the ecology of a tapeworm parasite that infects wild gelada monkeys in Ethiopia. Basic questions remain to be answered, including how the parasites impact gelada health and physiology, and how prevalent infections are. The project is lead by my labmate, Dr. India Schneider-Crease, who has done the hard work of applying for grants, collecting field data, and analyzing samples in the lab. We also draw from a decades worth of field data collected by research technicians and graduate students at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/gelada/">Gelada research project</a> field site in Ethiopia. My job is to help clean up and make sense of this hard-earned data. 

Currently, there are three parts to the project:

___

### Part 1: Tapeworm impact on host survival

It is unknown whether the parasites reduce host longevity. We perform survival analyses using 10 years of longitudinal data on parasitic cysts and host survival. A manuscript is under review at *The American Journal of Primatology*. 

### Part 2: Tapeworm effects on host hormones

It is hypothesized that this tapeworm species may manipulate host hormones. We use GLMMs to assess the effect of tapeworm infection on testosterone levels in males and oestrogen levels in females. We are in the data cleaning phase of this project.

### Part 3: Identifying undetected tapeworms

It is possible that undetected internal cysts are causing us to underestimate prevalence based on the presence of visible external cysts, so India developed an antigen assay for detecting infections from dried urine samples. We analyzed the results with GLMMs to investigate demographic patterns in infection. A manuscript is under review at *PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases*.
