I rarely make life update posts, but enough has happened in the past month that I thought it was worth posting about, especially since some of the changes will affect this blog! Here is the tl;dr version:

1. I accepted an [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) post-doctoral fellowship in Boston.
2. I am learning Python and avoiding R (except for emergencies).
3. I signed a contract with the Connecticut Whale [NWHL](https://www.nwhl.zone/) professional women's ice hockey team.

If you want to know a little more about these updates, read on!

### Insight Data Science Fellowship

This fellowship is specifically aimed at helping PhDs transition to data science jobs in industry. It's one of the best of it's kind, and I'm super excited for the chance to get some training and make connections that will help me jump start the next phase of my career. 

### Learning Python

It has come to my attention that there are more Python jobs than R jobs, and many jobs require both. Therefore, I am using my abundant free time this summer to learn Python and significantly expand the universe of jobs I am qualified for. Not incidentally, this is my first post written in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/), and while I'm at it I'll include my first line of Python code (written so as to prove that this is really not R!). 


```python
print("Hello " + "World!")
```

    Hello World!


Just as I removed Matlab from my computer when I was first learning R, I have forced myself to (mostly) give up R while I am learning Python. I'm not going to the extreme of removing it from my computer entirely, but I am trying to do everything in Python even when I know I could bang out some functional R code in my sleep. This means my productivity will plummet until I get better, but I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment.

### Connecticut Whale (NWHL)

I signed a [contract](https://www.theicegarden.com/2018/7/10/17553146/connecticut-whale-sign-randi-griffin-sarah-hughson-re-sign-hanna-beattie-team-korea-free-agency) with the Whale, so I am officially a professional ice hockey player! I have no idea what my role will be on this roster, but I am prepared for anything, even riding the pine. I'm just happy to be skating for another year. My personal keys for success this season:

- Health and fitness first
- Hit the singles
- Have fun

"Hit the singles" is something my college hockey coach used to say a lot. In case the baseball metaphor went over your head (it happens), it means you should make simple plays and avoid trying to do too much. My goal is basically to be as reliable as possible in lieu of being a little past my prime physically. If I can stay healthy and fit, that means I can play with Team Korea again at Worlds in China in April 2019, which is the ultimate goal!
