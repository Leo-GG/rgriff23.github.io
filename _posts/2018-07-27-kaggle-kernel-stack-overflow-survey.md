**Note: This post is so delayed because I've had a lot going on lately... you can look forward to some major life updates in my next post.**

So I joined [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) about a month ago - it's a site that hosts data science competitions, both exploratory data analysis and machine learning, sometimes for prizes and sometimes for fun. Kaggle is well known as a great resource for finding clean practice datasets and for learning/sharing data science skills with others. 

I decided to get my feet wet by entering a competition to analyze survey data from Stack Overflow, an online community for computer programmers. I wrote my "kernel" (that's what they call a script on Kaggle) in R Markdown, and I focused on a relatively narrow aspects of the 80+ question survey: How are age, gender, and sexual orientation related to feeling included in the Stack Overflow community and to responses to ethical choice questions? You can read my Kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/stack-overflow-2018-survey-age-gender-sexuality). 

To my surprise, Kaggle chose my analysis for the weekly Kernel Awards prize of $1000 on June 15th! I'm not sure how much of that was due to the awesomeness of my analysis and how much was due to Kaggle's preference for new users in their award selection process, but I appreciated it either way. That was definitely the best pay I've ever received for one day's work, and it's nice to have some validation of my work. Thanks Kaggle! :)
