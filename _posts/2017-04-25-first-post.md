Like many others who spend a lot of time in front of an R console, I possess an ever expanding junkyard of code that sprawls across multiple hard drives, Dropbox, GitHub, and probably a few other places. With every passing year, I find I spend less time writing fresh code and more time searching through old source files muttering to myself, "I KNOW I wrote a function for that somewhere...". Sometimes it takes a bit of digging, but I have saved countless hours of work this way.

But something that has saved me even more hours of work is the growing community of R users who share their code and knowledge online. Whenever a problem has me bamboozled, there is a good chance the solution will come from an unassuming post on a forum, listserve, or personal blog. Occasionally I am familiar with the hero who helped me solve my problem, but most of the time I am the anonymous recipient of an anonymous gift. It touches my heart every time. This blog is a way for me to contribute what I can to this online community.
