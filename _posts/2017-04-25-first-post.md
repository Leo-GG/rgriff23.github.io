Like many who spend a lot of time in front of an R console, I possess a junkyard of code that sprawls across multiple hard drives, Dropbox, GitHub, and probably a few other places. With every passing year, I spend less time writing fresh code and more time searching through old source files muttering, "I KNOW I wrote a function for that somewhere...". My old code has saved me from countless hours of reinventing the wheel.

But something that has saved me even more time is the growing community of R users who share their code and knowledge online. Whenever a problem has me bamboozled, there is a good chance the solution will come from an unassuming post on a forum, public listserve, or personal blog. Occasionally I am familiar with the person who helped me solve my problem, but most of the time I am the anonymous recipient of an anonymous gift. 

This blog is a way for me to gift what I can- useful scripts, solutions to problems, tutorials, etc. It is also a fun challenge for me to organize my code, figure out what is useful, and communicate it to people. I've always felt that I learn the most when I'm figuring out how to teach or explain something, and I expect to learn a lot while writing posts for this blog!
