Like others who spend a lot of time in front of an R console, I possess an ever expanding junkyard of code that sprawls across multiple hard drives, Dropbox, GitHub, and probably a few other places. With every passing year, I spend less time writing fresh code and more time searching through old source files muttering to myself, "I KNOW I wrote a function for that somewhere...".

My growing personal library of code improves my efficiency, but it pales in comparison to the benefit I've gotten from the growing online community of R hackers, bloggers, and developers. Whenever a problem has me bamboozled, there is a good chance the solution will come from an unassuming post on a forum, listserve, or personal blog. Occasionally I am familiar with the hero who helped me solve my problem, but most of the time I am the anonymous recipient of an anonymous gift. It touches my heart every time. 

This blog is a way for me to contribute more to this community. If my code junkyard is useful for me, then maybe it will be useful for others as well. And now that I have it, I'm excited for the excuse to do more writing as well!
