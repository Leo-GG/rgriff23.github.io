I rarely make life update posts, but this is a big enough deal that I thought it was worth posting about, especially since some of the changes will affect this blog! Here is the tl;dr version:

1. I accepted an [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) post-doctoral fellowship in Boston.
2. I am learning Python and avoiding R (except for emergencies).

If you want to know a little more about these updates, read on!

### Insight Data Science Fellowship

This fellowship is specifically aimed at helping PhDs transition to data science jobs in industry. I hear it's one of a kind, and I'm super excited for the chance to get some training and make connections that will help me jump start the next phase of my career. 

### Learning Python

It has come to my attention that there are more Python jobs than R jobs, and many jobs require both. Therefore, I am using my abundant free time this summer to learn Python and significantly expand the universe of jobs I am qualified for. Not incidentally, this is my first post written in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/), and while I'm at it I'll include my first line of Python code (written so as to prove that this is really not R!). 


```python
print("Hello " + "World!")
```

    Hello World!


Just as I removed Matlab from my computer when I was first learning R, I have forced myself to (mostly) give up R while I am learning Python. I'm not going to the extreme of removing it from my computer entirely, but I am trying to do everything in Python even when I know I could bang out some functional R code in my sleep. This means my productivity will plummet until I get better, but I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment.
