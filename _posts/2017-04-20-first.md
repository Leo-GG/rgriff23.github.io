```{r}
# comment
x <- 2
if (x > 1) print("kitten")
```
##Subsection

###Subsubsection

I have an ordered list.

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

However I also have an unordered list.

+ Thing
    - red
    - blue
+ Object
    - large
    - small
+ Stuff
    - inside
    - outside

####Subsubsubsection

Finally, what is the best kind of formatting? Some people like *italic* and others like **bold**, but I like ***both***.
