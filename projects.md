### Other

**This website**- My site is powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and hosted by <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It's nothing fancy, but it serves a purpose and I enjoy tinkering with it. Check out the source on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rgriff23/rgriff23.github.io">GitHub</a>!
